## /idlecard

Selects and prints a random card to the console. Colour-coded by card set. Rerolls if it picks an entry I don't have.

## /idlefund

Selects and prints something that coins can upgrade. Currently includes Anvil, Forge, Stamps, Cauldron, and Obols.
Forge, Stamps, and Cauldron will also print what subset to upgrade.

## /idlestat

Supply it with three numbers and it will distribute them amongst Tabs 1, 2, and 3. It will occasionally dump 5, 10, 25, or MAX points into one talent.
All points that go into Tab 3 Talent 15 get added to Tab 2.
Prints the three tabs and their points distributions when finished.
The 10 base talents are coloured.

## /idletask

Selects and prints a random task I have available on any character. Has a small chance to also select a Dungeon (1/15), Colosseum (1/50), and/or Totem (1/40).
I add to this whenever I open a new area. Might add Bosses at 1/25 rate.
